Talk about what the goal of this lab is !

# Data, Information and Knowledge 
## Relational Data

* What is the difference between data, information and knowledge? 

Information is data put in context; it is related to other pieces of data. Data are elements of analysis. Information is data with context. Knowledge is created by the very flow of information, anchored in the beliefs and commitment of its holder.

* If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are customers and orders explain the following:
(be sure to use the example in the chapter as a guide - customers and orders would be like clubs and events) 
a) What would be the primary key in the customers and orders table? 

b) How would the customers and orders table be related? 

c) What would be the foreign key in the orders table? 
 
d) The orders table would likely have a date field.  Explain why it is important to properly define the data type of a field. 
 
## Big Data

* Briefly describe the four "Vs" of big data 

IBM data scientists break big data into four dimensions: volume, variety, velocity and veracity.

* What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data? 

Predictive Analytics, NoSQL Databases, Knowledge Discovery Tools, Stream Analytics, In-memory Data Fabric, Distributed Storage, Data Virtualization, Data Integration, & Data Pre-processing have driven the increased need for big data.
 
# Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL 

RDBMS  is a common type of database that stores data in tables, so it can be used in relation to other stored datasets. SQL is the language used for communicating with data in an RDBMS. Or in the plain term, RDBMS is a book and SQL is the language being used in the book. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. 

* Pick two related tables from the diagram provided in the "module - SQL" and explain the relationship between them
a) which is the primary key?
b) which is the foreign key?
* Using W3Schools, try out a 
a) select statement 
a) where clause 
and upload screenshots of the results.
* Explain how SQL injections are a security threat and what can be done to reduce the issue.
