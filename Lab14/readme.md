# Executive Summary
Talk about what the goal of this lab is !

# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following:
a) Phone
b) House
c) Employee
* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
* 
* Identify the actions (In the video for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
* 
* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.

# Research Project
* Explain in 2 lines about your research project. Then answer each of the below questions.

My group project was primarly to research the ways IOT has changed life today and how it has prospered. My part was to include the major players and careers that lead the race in the cultivation of newest essential IOT devices programs, etc.
* How did you find your sources? What are sources that you should avoid when doing good research?
* I found alot of information using google scholars and using special characters in the google search engine to refer to educational sources using .org or .edu. I also took some information from interviews or testimonials from the people I researched but most of that way done prior to me having to complete then project for class. 
* What did you find most useful about doing this project? What did you learn?
* Doing this project , I found that the topics and how the leading techies like Elon, etc. were working on were topics that could change everyday like pertaing to the specific IOT device they were working on or change how we would interact with that IOT device altogether.Therefore, I learned that I should also look into topics that enlighten us as people to be able to live and work more efficiently. 
* What was the hardest part of doing this project? The hardest part of the project was actually correllating with the other group memebers and making sure they were doing their part as well.
* If a team member did not co-operate or had a different idea than yours, explain how you worked with that team member. I actually didn't come across this problem; my team was actually fine. 

# Conclusion
Include what you have learnt from this lab

I learned that when I create a class I can also include data within that class that can then be formatted into a json format to store data for any particular reason whether it be for a company or keeping track of animals.
