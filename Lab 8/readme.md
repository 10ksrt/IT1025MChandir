# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

<h6>The goal for this lab is to understand how data and command are transmitted through a computer and understand what the data thats being transmitted actually is.</h6>

# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10.
Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)

# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
* Packet
* Packet-Switching
* IP Address
* DNS
* Protocol

Packet - Unit of data
Packet-Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
IP Address - Unique identifying number
DNS - Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)
Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.

<h6>A hub moves data packects that come in one port and sends it out to the all other computers in that small network or LAN. However, a switch is able to determine where a packet should be sent by examining the MAC address. The switch learns the MAC addresses of what is connected to each port and stores it for later. Now when traffic comes in on a port, the switch looks at the destination address and compares it to the MAC address table. If a match is found, then the traffic is sent out to that one port and only that port.</h6>

* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches. 

<h6>A router is a small hardware device that joins multiple networks together that could be used by computers on the same/different network. A router can also be programmed to understand, manipulate, and route the data its being asked to handle. These networks can include wired or wireless home networks. A router is able to determine where to send a packet using the Network ID within the Network layer header. It then uses the routing table to determine the route to the destination host, similar to switch and hub operations but more efficient. </h6>

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.

<h6>A single point of failure is a potential risk posed by a flaw in the design, implementation or configuration of a circuit or system in which one fault or malfunction causes an entire system to stop operating. A topology that I found that experienced this issue was a bus topology, all the workstations connect to one backbone. If the backbone fails, the entire network will go down.</h6>

* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?

<h6>I think that Infrastructure Topology is better because Infrastructure topology is used in bigger networks and trait data wirelessly. In mesh topology, a message hops from one device to another in order to reach its  gateway. Infrastructure topology is normally used to extend a wired LAN to connect wireless capable devices as well as send data to other computers over that network.</h6>

# Conclusion
Summarize how this lab was useful to you and what you learnt that really interested you!

<h6>I thought this lab was intersting because I had to create a flowchart that helped me understand the "thinking" process of a computer and how data is sent and recieved. </h6>
