# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 

In a RGB color space, hex #ab00ff is composed of 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black. It has a hue angle of 280.2 degrees, a saturation of 100% and a lightness of 50%. #ab00ff color hex could be obtained by blending #ff00ff with #5700ff.

* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 



## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.  

* A truth table is a table that gives us the final truth of the data to find the correct output using the logic gates given. The table gives us the final truth of the input and output. A NAND Gate is a logic gate that performs the inverse operation of the "AND" logic gate meaning, this gates outputs are invers

* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? 

The NAND gate truth table compares to that of an AND gate

* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.
