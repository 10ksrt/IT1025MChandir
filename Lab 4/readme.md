# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

<h5> * The goal of this lab is to help students undestand the proccess within the terminal of what happens when you want to manipulate a WriteLine into an integer or other variable. It also helps students gain more background information on IEEE, a company that was developed for the betterment of humanity, computer science, and innovative technology and the representation of hexidecimals through the visual presentaion of different color of the spectrum. </h5>

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 

<h5> * In a RGB color space, hex #ab00ff is a pure violet composed of 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black. It has a hue angle of 280.2 degrees, a saturation of 100% and a lightness of 50%. #ab00ff color hex could be obtained by blending #ff00ff with #5700ff.
 </h5>


* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 

<h5> * I assume this color would be problematic given that the on https://www.colorhexa.com/ the keyword "Web Safe" is used when defining another 
shade or variation of #ab00ff, pure violet. I don't think #ab00ff would be the pure violet representaion to use when constructing a website. </h5>

## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.  

<h5> * A truth table is a table that gives us the final truth of the data to find the correct output using the logic gates given. The table gives us the final truth of the input and output. A NAND Gate is a logic gate that performs the inverse operation of the "AND" logic gate meaning, this gates outputs are invers </h5>

* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? 

<h5> The NAND gate truth table compares to that of an AND gate table by being the inverse or opposite operation of the AND truth table. If the AND input for A and B are both 1 the output would be equal to 1 as well. However,  when it comes to the NAND truth table if input A and B are both 1 the output would be equal to 0 instead. </h5>


* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.

<h5> * Logic Gate Exercises have been uploaded. I do not have microsoft word so the work was completed with my pc's basic computer text edit program but every time it opens up it reformats in a way the work can't be read but I still need/want credit for it so I uploaded a screenshot of my work with completed as well as uploaded my answers here. I know it's not what you asked for but I cannot use microsoft word.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design

<h5> * The mission statement and purpose of IEEE is to support professionals in their fields while also aiming to aid them in their efforts 
to apply and inspire other professionals for the betterment of humanity, computer science, and innovative technology. This includes engineers, scientists, 
and allied professionals computer scientists, software developers, information technology professionals, physicists, medical doctors, and many others. </h5>

<h5> * Undestanding software development you would be able to identify that any one person dedicated enough to finding a solution could create a 
program to solve that problem they're deailing with. With that being said, when it comes to creating innovative and new device designs they
must be created to not extend the boundaries of of moral principle as a society. As a software engineer or computer scientist; you could have
an issue with a fellow member of your group repository. That doesn't mean that you should create a device to negatively affect your fellow teammate. </h5>


Explain what you learnt from this lab

<h5> * From completing this lab I learned more about how to get to the output within a truth table. I also learned that a truth table is a table that gives us the final truth of the data to find the correct output using the logic gates given. Originally it was difficult for me to grasp this concept since I missed class but now it makes way more sense. </h5>
