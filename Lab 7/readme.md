# Executive Summary
Update this section for this lab explaining the purpose of the lab

The purpose of the lab is to explain the importance of the different files that and their purposes.

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.  
* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate 

Vector graphics allow you to modify or change the images size, etc. while raster are flexible and easy to use. The most obvious advantage of vector images over raster graphics is that vector images are quickly and perfectly scalable. There is no limit for scaling vector images. Digital graphic files will usually either be a vector or raster image/graphic. Vector graphics, such as logo files, use intricate paths made up of points and lines to create an image. Raster graphics are created using a grid of tiny pixels. For example using abobe photoshop you can create a rasterixed image but using adobe illustraator yoou can create vector images.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?  

If you are looking to retain the highest quality for your images, you should choose lossless over lossy compression. If you choose to go with lossless compression for your images, the trade-off is that you will have larger files. So you will need to find other ways to optimize your website's performance.

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files. 

Image result for the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files
PNG is excellent for graphics, as it supports transparency in browsers with an elegance that GIF does not have. PNG supports 8-bit color like GIF, but also has 24-bit color RGB, like JPG does. They are also non-lossy files, compressing photographic images without degrading image quality.

# Operating Systems
Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks
* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required
*
It took me over ten layers to creat this logo. I had to also create seperate layers using the brush tool to create the cheese and toppings. I first started with making multiple layer of triangles and ellipses using the pen tool. Then I overlapped and shaded those layers with the brush tool. After 2 hours of mixing, coloring, and shading. After that I was done.

* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)

the file size is 354 bytes and the application it opens with is Visual Studio Code, my C# app for my other IT class. It would be more appropriate
## Thumbnail
Upload thumbnail to github (In class work)
 
# Conclusion
Summarize what you learned here

I learned that images can be created and stored as data over the net as a svg file that's converted into a line of code. I also learned that different kinds of files produce different results like downloading and image for the highest quality as an png file versus a jpeg file.
