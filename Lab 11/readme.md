# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.

<h6>A code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly and with integrity. A code of ethics, also referred to as an "ethical code," may encompass areas such as business ethics, a code of professional practice, and an employee code of conduct. The ACM Code of Ethics is a collection of principles and guidelines designed to help computing professionals make ethically responsible decisions in professional practice. It affirms an obligation of computing professionals, both individually and collectively, to use their skills for the benefit of society.</h6>



* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 

<h6>An acceptable use policy (AUP), acceptable usage policy or fair use policy, is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator or administrator of a network, website, or service, that restrict the ways in which the network, website or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used while a code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly.</h6>

* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 

<h6> The site I chose was google workspace, and the AUP or fair use policy for this site is located at https://workspace.google.com/terms/use_policy.html and it states that "You agree not to, and not to allow third parties or Your End Users, to use the Services:

to generate or facilitate unsolicited bulk commercial email;
to violate, or encourage the violation of, the legal rights of others;
for any unlawful, invasive, infringing, defamatory, or fraudulent purpose;
to intentionally distribute viruses, worms, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or other items of a destructive or deceptive nature;
to interfere with the use of the Services, or the equipment used to provide the Services, by customers, authorized resellers, or other authorized users;
to alter, disable, interfere with or circumvent any aspect of the Services;
to test or reverse-engineer the Services in order to find limitations, vulnerabilities or evade filtering capabilities;
to grant multiple individuals access to an individual End User Account other than via the delegation features provided within the Services;
to create End User Accounts assigned to business functions rather than to human beings for the purpose of sharing files within or outside of the domain;
to resell End User Accounts or parts thereof as added into a commercial product offered to third parties;
to record audio or video communications without consent if such consent is required by applicable laws and regulations (You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction(s))."</h6>

## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 

<h6>WIPO is the global forum for intellectual property (IP) services, policy, information and cooperation. Their mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all. WIPO helps governments, businesses and society realize the benefits of IP.</h6>
