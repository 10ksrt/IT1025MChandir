# Executive Summary
Include your executive summary here..

In my opinio so far, based of what I understand of this lab, this lab is required for students to understand how compressed files work and optimize data. This lab also helps students understand a URL, how they work, and how business could protect their data, goods, and services from copyright infringment over the web. 

# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.

<h6>A code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly and with integrity. A code of ethics, also referred to as an "ethical code," may encompass areas such as business ethics, a code of professional practice, and an employee code of conduct. The ACM Code of Ethics is a collection of principles and guidelines designed to help computing professionals make ethically responsible decisions in professional practice. It affirms an obligation of computing professionals, both individually and collectively, to use their skills for the benefit of society.</h6>



* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 

<h6>An acceptable use policy (AUP), acceptable usage policy or fair use policy, is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator or administrator of a network, website, or service, that restrict the ways in which the network, website or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used while a code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly.</h6>

* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 

<h6> The site I chose was google workspace, and the AUP or fair use policy for this site is located at https://workspace.google.com/terms/use_policy.html and it states that "You agree not to, and not to allow third parties or Your End Users, to use the Services:

to generate or facilitate unsolicited bulk commercial email;
to violate, or encourage the violation of, the legal rights of others;
for any unlawful, invasive, infringing, defamatory, or fraudulent purpose;
to intentionally distribute viruses, worms, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or other items of a destructive or deceptive nature;
to interfere with the use of the Services, or the equipment used to provide the Services, by customers, authorized resellers, or other authorized users;
to alter, disable, interfere with or circumvent any aspect of the Services;
to test or reverse-engineer the Services in order to find limitations, vulnerabilities or evade filtering capabilities;
to grant multiple individuals access to an individual End User Account other than via the delegation features provided within the Services;
to create End User Accounts assigned to business functions rather than to human beings for the purpose of sharing files within or outside of the domain;
to resell End User Accounts or parts thereof as added into a commercial product offered to third parties;
to record audio or video communications without consent if such consent is required by applicable laws and regulations (You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction(s))."</h6>

## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 

<h6> WIPO is the global forum for intellectual property (IP) services, policy, information and cooperation. Their mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all. WIPO helps governments, businesses and society realize the benefits of IP.</h6>

* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 

<h6> A copyright is obtained by the simple act of creating the original work. In other words, when an author writes down that song, makes that film, or designs that program, he or she automatically has the copyright. However, for a work that will be used commercially, it is advisable to register for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. A registered copyright is needed in order to bring legal action against someone who has used a work without permission. 

If I created a svg image it would be important to copyright the image so that I would be protected commercially if anyone was to illegal use my image that I created. </h6>

* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 

<h6>The first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. ยง 109, provides that an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display or otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the interests of the copyright owner. </h6>
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet. 


<h6>FERPA, or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, protects the privacy of student education records. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) addresses data protection regulations for children under the age of 13 on platform supported by gooogle like youtube, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is designed to protect the privacy and security of individuals within the healthcare industry.</h6>

# URLs and File Paths

* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 

<h6>Terms: 
scheme - https, 
domain -  www.amazon.com, 
top level domain - .edu, 
default page - no file path provided, 
parameters - result of search, 
anchor - specific location on a page </h6>


* What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why? 

<h6> An absolute path specifies the location from the root directory and carries detailed information, whereas relative path is related to the current directory and carries only a part of the absolute pathway. Using relative paths allows you to construct your site offline and fully test it before uploading it. An absolute path refers to a file on the Internet using its full URL. Absolute paths tell the browser precisely where to go. Absolute paths are easier to use and understand. Constructing my website I would use a absolute path only because it's easier to use, the data is stored directly within the root directory, and the location of the site would be precise which ay be ideal for SEO marketing. </h6>

* Explain the purpose and use of file compression.

Compressed files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files, allowing large files to be zipped and stored with a small capacity of data.

# Conclusion
Include your conclusion here...

<h6> In conclusion this lab helps the student understand multiple ways to compressed files and optimize data with the CPU as well as over the cloud or internet. This lab also helps the student (me) understand what makes up a URL and how business could protect their data, goods, and services from copyright infringment over the web. </h6>
