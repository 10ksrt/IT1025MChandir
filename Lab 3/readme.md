# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

* The purpose of this lab and assignment is to help students undertaking programming and development in the field of infomation technology to understand where data is stored and the differeces beteween the ways you could store data, and how data interacts with the CPU on a multitude of levels from downloading and storing the information on different pieces of hardware to how it is processed and transmitted through code using binary.

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?

* 
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?

* A solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a triditional hard drive because it is portable and can transfer data stored not just on your standard CPU but to any other CPU as well. A traditional hardrive can also be removed however it would require skill or professional assistance and would be a much more difficult task to perfom than removing your everyday traditional (SSD) hard drive. 

* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?

* Increasing RAM makes your computer run faster because more data can be loaded into the faster RAM without accessing the slower Hard Drive. This is why you must also run your programs through the RAM of your computer and not the hard drive. 

* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?

* The term 64 or 32 bit data path refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in one clock cycle. The more bits that are transferred in one clock cycle the faster the computer will be. If your computrer in running on a 32 bit data path it will run slower. 

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU

* The control unit or "captain" of the CPU recieves intructions from the RAM and breaks that instuction down into command for the other components of the CPU to use and process like the Arthimetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU performs all of the mathematical operations inside of the CPU. The conrtol unit tells the ALU what operation to perfom allowing the ALU to output an answer from the original input or instruction from the RAM. 

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output

*In our example they address the CPU as the Central Processing Unit that calculates information, the Input as processed binary info, and the Output as the information or data that is converted into the physical output from that binary information that's processed as data from the RAM for the CPU to come up with that output.

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 
*
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)

    1,    1,   0,   1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 
_______________________________
 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

<b>Work Shown Below</b> 

211 - 128 = 83

83 - 64 = 19 

19 - 16 = 3 

3 - 2 = 1

1 - 1 = 0

*
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)

    1,     0,   1,   1,    0, 1, 0, 1, 0
______________________________
    8,     7,   6,   5,    4, 3, 2, 1, 0
_______________________________
256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 0

256+64+32+8+2 = 362
*
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)

*192 = C

192 / 16 = 12

12 = C
