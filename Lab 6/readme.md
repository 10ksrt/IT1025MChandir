## Career Exploration

#### Tri-C College Central:

Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.

## Industry Certification
* Explore a certification and report your findings. (CompTIA , Cisco , CISSP or any other certification)

<h6> The certification I looked into was the CISSP. The CISSP certification is one of the toughest and most sought-after certifications. Being CISSP certified in today's world means that you are in the top league of cybersecurity professionals around the world when it comes to both knowledge and experience. The CISSP certification has become a required certification for a lot of careers within the IT/Cyber security field.</h6>

## College Certificates
* Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.)

<h6> A Tri-C Certificate that interested me was the certificate in Mobile Application Development because one day I'd like to create an app that connects local sneakerheads and fashion icons in their hometowns to underground & uprisisng streetwear brands around the world. </h6>

* Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship

<h6> Volunteering is a perfect way to learn about a possible career or gain experience, itâ€™s also helpful to think about your skills and interests in that area. You can also show employers you're a self-starter by learning something new on your own time or drafting a resume. </h6>

<h6> Co-ops are traditionally full-time, paid positions. CO-OP allows you to test-drive your career and studies, apply skills learned in the classroom to the workplace, and help develop and perfect your professional skills. </h6>

## Professional Membership
* Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.

<h6> IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity as they say. its members inspire a global community through its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional activities; so to become a member of IEEE is to be a member of a world leading company in IT. If someone was to have a good history of working with IEEE on their resume they could most likely be accepted in most Tech companies around the world just through IEEE's voucher. </h6>

# Conclusion
Summary of your understanding from this week's lab

<h6> This week's lab in my opinion was about the available growing opportunities in the within IT related to our field of study as well as the salary differences. I enjoyed learning that the median salary was actually $107,000 and some change. I assumed it was around $65-70,000 but now I know I was mistaken. </h6>
