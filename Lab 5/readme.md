# Executive Summary

# Software 
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each. 

* <h6> The operating system manages the tangible hardware and create the interface between the user and hardware itself. Application software only performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting and database management, as well as web browsing. However, utility software is typically used to clean or rid the PC on hand of malware, viruses, or other programs that the user would no longer want installed.</h6> 

* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example. 

* <h6> Enterprise Resource Planning (also called ERP or Enterprise Software) was developed to unite an entire organization within just one program utilizing a central that's implemented through the entire organization. Two examples of the following could be; SAP ERP or Microsoft Dynamics. </h6>

# Virtualization

Read the article 
https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization

* In addition to the chapter use the following resource:  https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html#how-it-works
and explain the purpose of virtualization. 

* <h6>The purpose of virtualization is to only be able to perform the tasks of multiple computer while only simulating those tasks by using a virtual machine (VM). Having a VM also allows the user to be able to run programs that would be usually be incompatible with the PC's original hardware and software.</h6>

* <h6>Virtualization is software that makes computing environments independent of physical infrastructure, while cloud computing is a service that delivers shared computing resources (software and/or data) on demand via the Internet. Virtualization is just software technology where the cloud is just an environment that regulates data over the internet.</h6>

#### Explain the following: 
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization? 

* <h6>If all your virtual hosts are running the same virtualisation software, all your virtual machines Common platform for servers. Using native virtual backup software like how a VM can make backing up servers incredibly easy. Compute hardware is also so powerful these days it's actually a waste of memory  to run servers using the bare. Hardware than it it to just use a VM  instead.</h6>

* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization? 

* <h6>With virtualization, software called a hypervisor sits on top of physical hardware and abstracts the machine's resources, which are then made available to virtual environments called virtual machines. These resources can be raw processing power, storage, or cloud-based applications containing all the runtime code and resources required to deploy it.</h6>

#### Cloud computing vs. Virtualization: 
    https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/cloud-vs-virtualization  
 
* In your own words explain the difference between cloud computing and virtualization

* <h6>In simpler terms virtualization is downloading software to have a Virtual Machine implanted onto the user’s PC, while cloud computing is data that’s shared via the Internet for an application or to complete a service. </h6>

*  <h6>Virtualization only simulates the user's tasks by using a virtual machine (VM) while cloud computing operates on the internet, storing data, running applications, and performing services on one PC where the data can be accessed from other PCs via the internet. </h6>

* Explain how a network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing? 

* <h6>Virtualization is just hardware manipulation technology that also makes cloud computing possible on a virtual machine. Virtualization can make one resource act like many, while cloud computing lets different users access a pool of data or resources while browsing over the internet, making it no problem for a network administrator to move from virtualization to cloud computing. </h6>
