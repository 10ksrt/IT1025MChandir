Let’s look at the modern day ATM for example; it is an automated teller machine. The modern ATM’s tangible hardware is made up of an card reader, printer, digital screen, and cash dispenser. Your standard ATM may have an operating system that runs on Microsoft Windows OS while other models run off of Windows XP or Windows XP Embedded. This software is used to transfer data to and from the bank, user’s account, and active ATM. A bulk a of data can be transferred per transaction. The type of information you could expect to find could range anywhere from someone’s name to their cvv, PIN number, account cash value, or account and routing number.  Due to the fact that this teller machine has minimal functions, the user would most likely always be anyone trying to access an account for money or currency. The support staff for a machine of this caliber could range anywhere from a small IT team of professionals, to the business owner or bank that owns the ATM. However for this machine to work a user must enter a pin number to transfer his/her data back and forth from both his bank, to his account, and then that active ATM in order for the machine to dispense the exact amount needed in that moment. 

2.  Known as “client-server,” this networking architecture allowed users to log in to the Local Area Network (LAN) from their PC (the “client”) by connecting to a central computer called a “server.” Github allows code to be edited and shared through different projects or repositories so to say for other developers to be able to improve your code. However Github also allows other users to access your code via the Cloud service they provide or by using a Local Are Network for the users who are permitted to access the code within that repository. Github allows the user to save their code onto the Cloud, an operating system within Github’s Software that allows users to store data outside of their hard drive on their PC, in order to decrease the amount of data used on machine. This same process can also be seen being used by other companies that work within the field of storing and transferring data like Apple Inc., Microsoft, Google, Adobe Studio, and many more. These were a few examples in which I also use in my day to day life. 


* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

___________
ATM 

HARDWARE - CARD READER, PRINTER, SCREEN, CASH DISPENSER

SOFTWARE - Microsoft Windows OS, WINDOWS XP, WINDOWS XP Embedded

Data- First & Last Name, CVV, Pin #, Account Value , Time, Date, Location, Cash Value, 

 front-line user - person using pin # to access money. In their account. 

Support staff - owner of the operating atm . Could be either one owner or bank owned. 

Process - Front line user enters a pin # to transfer data back from both his bank, account, and active atm in order for the machine to dispense the exact amount needed in that moment.

Hardware
Hardware is the tangible, physical portion of an information system – the part you can touch. Computers, keyboards, disk drives, and flash drives are all examples of information systems hardware 

Software
Two main categories of software are: Operating Systems and Application software. Operating Systems software provides the interface between the hardware and the Application software. Examples of operating systems for a personal computer include Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu Linux. The mobile phone operating system market is dominated by Google Android and Apple iOS. Application software allows the user to perform tasks such as creating documents, recording data in a spreadsheet, or messaging a friend. 

Data
You can think of data as a collection of facts. For example, your address (street, city state, postal code), your phone number, and your social networking 

People
From the front-line user support staff, to systems analysts, to developers, all the way up to the chief information officer (CIO), the people involved with information systems are an essential element. 

Process
A process is a series of steps undertaken to achieve a desired outcome or goal. Information systems are becoming more integrated with organizational processes, bringing greater productivity and better control to those processes.

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture. Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model.

 Known as “client-server,” this networking architecture allowed users to log in to the Local Area Network (LAN) from their PC (the “client”) by connecting to a central computer called a “server.” Github allows code to be edited and shared through different projects or repositories so to say for other developers to be able to improve your code. However Github also allows other users to access your code via the Cloud service they provide or by using a Local Are Network for the users who are permitted to access the code within that repository. Github allows the user to save their code onto the Cloud, an operating system within Github’s Software that allows users to store data outside of their hard drive on their PC, in order to decrease the amount of data used on machine. This same process can also be seen being used by other companies that work within the field of storing and transferring data like Apple Inc., Microsoft, Google, Adobe Studio, and many more. These were a few examples in which I also use in my day to day life. 

 
* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use? 

GitHub is considered cloud computing because we store our repositories and data involving code, group projects , etc. over the internet and not on our tangible hardrives in our computers. A few aother cloud services that are similar that I use are google cloud, dropbox, and icloud to store videos, photos, and other media to save on storage in my phone.
