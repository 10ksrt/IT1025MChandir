# Executive summary
Type your executive summary as if you were explaining your lab on an IT team

This lab's purpose is to help novice developers understand the processes of hardware, software, data, the people active within that process, and the whole process of how those departments of the computer work within themselves. 

# Information System Components  

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

1. Information technology is used in an array of operating systems today no matter how big or small the device may be. Let’s look at the modern day ATM for example; it is an automated teller machine. The modern ATM’s tangible hardware is made up of an card reader, printer, digital screen, and cash dispenser. Your standard ATM may have an operating system that runs on Microsoft Windows OS while other models run off of Windows XP or Windows XP Embedded. This software is used to transfer data to and from the bank, user’s account, and active ATM. A bulk a of data can be transferred per transaction. The type of information you could expect to find could range anywhere from someone’s name to their cvv, PIN number, account cash value, or account and routing number.  Due to the fact that this teller machine has minimal functions, the user would most likely always be anyone trying to access an account for money or currency. The support staff for a machine of this caliber could range anywhere from a small IT team of professionals, to the business owner or bank that owns the ATM. However for this machine to work a user must enter a pin number to transfer his/her data back and forth from both his bank, to his account, and then that active ATM in order for the machine to dispense the exact amount needed in that moment. 

Hardware - CARD READER, PRINTER, SCREEN, CASH DISPENSER

Software - Microsoft Windows OS, WINDOWS XP, WINDOWS XP Embedded

Data - First & Last Name, CVV, Pin #, Account Value , Time, Date, Location, Cash Value, 

People - The front-line user or person using pin # to access money from their account. Support staff and owner of the operating atm, it could be either one owner or bank owned. 

Process - Front line user enters a pin # to transfer data back from both his bank, account, and active atm in order for the machine to dispense the exact amount needed in that moment. 

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 

Known as “client-server,” this networking architecture allowed users to log in to the Local Area Network (LAN) from their PC (the “client”) by connecting to a central computer called a “server.” Github allows code to be edited and shared through different projects or repositories so to say for other developers to be able to improve your code. However Github also allows other users to access your code via the Cloud service they provide or by using a Local Are Network for the users who are permitted to access the code within that repository. 

* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?

GitHub is considered cloud computing because we store our repositories and data involving code, group projects , etc. over the internet and not on our tangible hard drives in our computers.Github allows the user to save their code onto the Cloud, an operating system within Github’s Software that allows users to store data outside of their hard drive on their PC, in order to decrease the amount of data used on machine. This same process can also be seen being used by other companies that work within the field of storing and transferring data like Apple Inc., Microsoft, Google, Adobe Studio, and many more. These were a few examples in which I also use in my day to day life. A few other cloud services that are similar that I use are google cloud, dropbox, and iCloud to store videos, photos, and other media to save on storage in my phone. 

# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.
